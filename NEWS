Changes in version 2.0.0
    - features:
        - automated mechanism for performing simulations
        - mechanism to add new models (i.e., generator, sampler, estimator, and comparator)
        - mechanism for splitting simulations across multiple processes
        - error and warning handling and capturing for review
        - mechanism to interactively specify a simulation design
        - mechanism for approximating the duration of a simulation design
        - mechanism to generate `R6` object instances in a multi-threading fashion
        - scaffolder for generating boilerplate code for new models and graphs
        - mechanism to keep track of the instantiation time and ancestry of an object
        - mechanism to ask console questions and capture and parse user input
        - mechanism to replicate simulations (i.e., simulator -> simulations -> replications)
        - various utility functions
    - improvements:
        - changed codebase to use `R6` classes and pass-by-reference semantics
        - ASCII logo (i.e., color and non-color version)
        - custom plotting (i.e, image-based plot for each replication and `.pdf` for each simulation)
        - informative printing for user-accessible `R6` objects
        - progress bar for all repetitive actions
        - resampling possibility in case variables in generated data show no variance
    - fixes: n.a.



Changes in version 1.0.0
    - features:
        - simulation script according to the master thesis (i.e., 27 network structures)
    - improvements: n.a.
    - fixes: n.a.
